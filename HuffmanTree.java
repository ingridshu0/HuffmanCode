/**
 * How Huffman Code works:
 * Given a string, the program generates a Map of key / value pairs containing the frequency of each character and space in the sentence.
 * This data is organized in a PriorityQueue (from least to most occurrences), which is then sorted via Huffman Code
 * Huffman Code: generates a tree where each leaf is a different value. To trace through the tree, use binary code to get to the leafs
 * (0 = left, 1 = right)
